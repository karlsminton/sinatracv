## Sinatra CV

Building my CV as a working application using;

* Ruby
* Sinatra
* ActiveRecord
* Rake
* Tailwindcss

The application is served through a front controller which handles a few basic routes.
The routes are populated by a Page model, via ActiveRecord.
We use Rake & ActiveRecord to create some simple migrations, creating the pages table and populating it with data.
